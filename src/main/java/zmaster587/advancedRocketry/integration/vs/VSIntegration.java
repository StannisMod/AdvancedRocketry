/**
 * Soft-dependency gate for Valkyrien Skies (TASK-47, "true spaceships").
 *
 * <p>AR depends on VS <em>optionally</em>: we compile against the VS API
 * ({@code compileOnly}) but never bundle or require it. The whole true-spaceship
 * feature lights up only when the user also installs VS; without VS, AR must boot
 * and behave exactly as before.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Boundary rule — do not break:</b> this class MUST NOT import or reference
 * any {@code org.valkyrienskies.*} type, so it is always safe for the JVM to
 * load. Every VS-touching call goes through {@link VSBridge}, which is reached
 * only behind {@link #isAvailable()} — so a VS-importing class is never loaded on
 * an AR install without VS, and there is no {@code NoClassDefFoundError}. The
 * unit test {@code VSIntegrationTest} pins this contract. Rationale and the
 * dependency-mode decision live in {@code .agent/tasks/TASK-47-*}.</p>
